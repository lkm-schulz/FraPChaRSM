# Framework for Performance Characterization of Resource Sharing Mechanisms 
*or better known by its catchy name of FraPChaRSM*

This repository is part of my Bachelor's Thesis on the design and implementation of a framework for performance characterization of resource sharing mechanisms in distributed computing. It hosts all code and artifacts used and produced for this work.

Currently, traversing and understanding all parts of this repository could be considered a scientific contribution by itself due to its poorly organized state. All code will be refactored and improved in the coming weeks. This document will be updated to provide actually useful information about the project as well as instructions to run the experiments.
